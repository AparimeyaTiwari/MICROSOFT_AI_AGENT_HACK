      "Failure to pay wages to employees is a serious offense in India and can attract legal action under various laws. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of legal actions that may be taken:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Applicable Law**\n",
      "- **The Payment of Wages Act, 1936**  \n",
      "- **The Minimum Wages Act, 1948**  \n",
      "- **Indian Penal Code (IPC)** ‚Äì Section 406 (Criminal Breach of Trust) and Section 420 (Cheating)  \n",
      "- **Industrial Disputes Act, 1947**  \n",
      "- **Code of Wages, 2019**  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Summary**\n",
      "1. **Payment of Wages Act, 1936**:  \n",
      "   This law requires employers to pay wages on time and without unauthorized deductions. If the company fails to release salaries, employees can file a complaint with the local labor authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Minimum Wages Act, 1948**:  \n",
      "   Employers are mandated to pay at least the statutory minimum wages. Failure to do so is a punishable offense.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Code of Wages, 2019**:  \n",
      "   This unified law consolidates provisions for timely payment of wages, minimum wages, and eliminates unfair practices. Non-payment can invite penalties and legal action.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Indian Penal Code (IPC)**:  \n",
      "   If there is intentional fraud or breach of trust (e.g., withholding salaries despite having funds), criminal action may be initiated under Sections 406 and 420.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Industrial Disputes Act, 1947**:  \n",
      "   If the employer violates contractual obligations, employees can raise a dispute before the Labor Tribunal or Labor Court.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### **3. Next Steps**\n",

      "- **Step 1**: **Send a demand notice**: Write to the employer demanding immediate release of wages due. Keep proof of communication. Highlight the legal obligations and potential consequences.\n",
      "- **Step 2**: **File a complaint with the Labor Commissioner**: Approach the local Labor Commissioner or relevant labor authority in your region.\n",
      "- **Step 3**: **Initiate Civil Action**: Under the CPC, you can file a civil suit for recovery of unpaid wages along with interest and other damages.\n",
      "- **Step 4**: **Criminal Action**: If there‚Äôs evidence of fraudulent intent or breach of trust, file a criminal complaint under IPC Sections 406 and 420 at the nearest police station.\n",
      "\n",
      "**For Government Employees**:\n",
      "- Government employees can assert their rights under specific service rules applicable to their department and approach service tribunals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If Issue Impacts Workers on Minimum Wage**:\n",
      "- Approach a labor inspector or file appropriate legal action under the Minimum Wages Act and/or the Code of Wages, 2019 for recovery and penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Recommendations**:\n",
      "- **Keep all documentation**: Retain the employment agreement, salary slips, emails, and other relevant communication.\n",
      "- **Consult a labor law advocate**: If the company does not resolve the matter, hire a lawyer to escalate the issue legally.\n",
      "- **Collective Action**: If multiple employees face the same issue, consider filing as a group or approaching a trade union for collective representation.\n",
